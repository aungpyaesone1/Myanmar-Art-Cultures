<p class="p1">The Myanmar dance moves from ancient times were known by carefully analyzing and rediscovering the murals on the temple ruins in Myanmar.</p>
<p class="p1">This is especially true for Bagan Dances. For other dances, historic books and literature showed accounts, while our links to Ayuthdaya (Thai) and India suggested similarities in our dances. Of course, the inherited dance moves from generation to generation in dance troupes also taught us how the Myanmar dances were like in the days before British colonialism.</p>
<p class="p1">There are several basic dance moves and postures an aspiring dancer has to learn. Chin up, chest out, bottoms up, knees bend is a strict to rule to follow by. In addition, a smile has to be always on the face, unless otherwise required by the particular dance. Myanmar dance requires the movement of every body part that one has. From the eye to the chin, from the shoulders to the fingers, and from the waist to the feet. There can be lively music that requires much jumping, or there can be classical music that requires much grace. Indeed, although at a glance, the dance may look easy, learning it can prove to be hard.</p>
