<p class="p1">Mystic Ball is a documentary about the traditional Chinlone sport of Myanmar. The film is a thrilling sports movie, an insightful journey to a new world, and a lyrical personal story.</p>
<p class="p1">Mystic Ball follows Greg Hamilton, the filmmaker, deep into the ancient and little-known culture of Myanmar and its traditional sport, chinlone. Like the film, chinlone is hard to define. It's a team sport without an opposing team, part dance, part meditation.</p>
<p class="p1">There is no competition, no winners and no losers. The game is back-breakingly difficult, yet is played by almost all Burmese, from young children to octogenarians.</p>
<p class="p1">The film follows Greg's transformation from outsider obsessed with learning chinlone to accomplished teammate of the masters of the game. But sport is only one aspect of his journey. Through chinlone, Greg discovers things he didn't even know he was looking for: family, community and love.</p>
<p class="p1">Mystic Ball's stunning cinematography and inspiring story will give you a sense of the mystical, and encourage a closer look at your own journey.</p>
