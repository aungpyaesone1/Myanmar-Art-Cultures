<p class="p1">Pottery has been the earliest craft in the history of human civilization. People in the terrain area had began to make use of pots, which could be easily and cheaply produced. Although pots are fragile, these can be made use in many useful ways. Pots were not only used to store or cook food but also as burial urns to bury gold and jewelleries.</p>
<p class="p1">The remains of some old pots used during the Pyu civilizations were discovered, giving evidences that pots had been used since then. Remains were also found in Bagan and Mrauk-U regions. Today, the main pottery works in Myanmar are situated in Nwe Nyein village near Kyauk Myaung, a river-side town near Shwebo and Twante near Yangon.</p>

After sieving several times, the powder is allowed to seep in water for some days. After the silt has settled, the clear water is poured away and the remaining clay worked over until smooth. After that, lumps of it are rolled and given over to the potter. Even though plastic, steel, aluminium wares are available, hand-made pottery is still very much preferred by Myanmar and still in use in the cultural traditions.</p>
