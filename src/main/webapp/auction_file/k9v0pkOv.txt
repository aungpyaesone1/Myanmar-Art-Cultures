<p class="p1">This monastery is famous for its beautiful wood-carvings. This wooden monastery is carved all over with motifs and mythical creatures. It was once entirely covered in thick gold, but only the interior gold remains due to harshness of the tropical weather. Some of the outer carvings have been prised off and removed being damaged by the weather. Inside the monastery, there are 10 jataka scenes taken from the Buddha's life. These are still in a very good condition.</p>
